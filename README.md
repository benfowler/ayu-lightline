## About
This [lightline.vim](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) theme is based off of the existing [ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme) theme and is, currently, still a work in progress. 

I have only created the `mirage` color scheme with plans to add `dark` and `light` variants at a later time.

## Installation
Clone or download the theme, and copy `ayu.vim` to `~/.vim/bundle/lightline.vim/autoload/lightline/colorscheme`.

Apply the theme in your `.vimrc` by adding -- or editing -- the following,
```vim
let g:lightline = {
        \ 'colorscheme': 'ayu',
        \ }
```
